[x] correct P2 Canvas Assignment submission on time [none]: 
[x] completed p2-workbook.txt in the for_student folder correctly [none]: 
[x] clear explanations in p1-workbook.txt [none]: 
[x] program runs (or seems to run correctly - worth looking at error console) [final-grtown]: In my browser, it doesn't work as a frame embedded in a page, but it works when you open gr-01-01.html in its own tab. Takes a little bit of time (~20 seconds for me) to load because of the shadows.
[x] frame rate seems OK (not too slow) [final-grtown]: Object behaviors fall out of sync when the page is reloaded or navigated away from; wait ~15 seconds for behaviors to reset and sync up.
[x] UI is there and seems to work (can lookat and ride) [final-grtown]: Riding works but "follow object" tends to not actually look at the object.
[x] highlight list looks OK [final-grtown]: 
[x] visually distinct from example [final-grtown]: 
[x] theme makes sense (need explanation) [final-grtown]: My town is a farm that's being invaded by aliens.
[ ] cool theme bonus (need explanation) [final-grtown]: 
[x] objects created for this assignment 1, not trivial, can be identified in world (need explanation) [final-grtown]: Articulated aliens made of primitives that run along a cubic curve path. "Alien-1" on the highlist list.
[x] objects created for this assignment 2, not trivial, can be identified in world (need explanation) [final-grtown]: Car made of primitives, spotlights, and ExtrudeGeometries that drives along the road. "Car-1" on the highlight list.
[x] 5 more kinds of objects 1, not trivial, can identify (need explanation) [final-grtown]: Wheat field made of a plane deformed with noise & math with two different crop circle designs. Textures that I made myself (all assets described in attribution.txt). "Wheat Field-6" on highlist list.
[x] 5 more kinds of objects 2, not trivial, can identify (need explanation) [final-grtown]: Flying saucer made of primitives with two different forms, stationary and flying. "Saucer-1" and "Saucer-2" in highlight list. The flying one flies around and then beams up a cow from the cow pen.
[x] 5 more kinds of objects 3, not trivial, can identify (need explanation) [final-grtown]: Alien riding scooter made of primitives. "Scooter Alien-3" in highlight list. Moves differently than the running aliens and travels along a cardinal spline.
[x] 5 more kinds of objects 4, not trivial, can identify (need explanation) [final-grtown]: Swarm of fireflies made of sprites. "Firefly Swarm-1" in highlight list.
[x] 5 more kinds of objects 5, not trivial, can identify (need explanation) [final-grtown]: Cows (spot the cow model) that randomly turn in small increments and bounce around inside the fence. One cow follows a particular path where it exits the barn and gets beamed up by the flying saucer.
[x] has building, natural, vehicle (need explanation) [final-grtown]: Barn/houses/fences/silos are buildings, trees/wheat/fireflies are natural, cows/aliens/scooters/saucers/car are vehicles.
[x] loaded model (need explanation) [final-grtown]: For the cows, I loaded an obj and texture of Spot the Cow from https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/Projects/ModelRepository/. The model and texture are under a universal free-use license. Attribution for other things I downloaded in attribution.txt.
[x] shader: identifiable and not trivial (need explanation) [final-grtown]: The beam on the flying saucer uses a shader that I made. The vertex shader grows and shrinks the beam depending on time and uv value, and there are also ripples in the beam that change shape over time. The fragment shader creates color ripples and also modulates the material opacity.
[x] three behaviors you made 1, not trivial, can be identified in scene (need explanation) [final-grtown]: Aliens on scooters have articulated leg and head movement and they travel along a cardinal spline.
[x] three behaviors you made 2, not trivial, can be identified in scene (need explanation) [final-grtown]: The cows in the fence turn slightly each frame and bounce off the fence when they reach the boundary. There's code to stop them from getting stuck if they somehow end up outside the fence.
[x] three behaviors you made 3, not trivial, can be identified in scene (need explanation) [final-grtown]: The flying saucer is synced up with a particular cow so that when it finishes its flight path, it pauses and creates a beam that sucks up the cow.
[x] at least one object is rideable / followable [final-grtown]: 
[x] behavior that is not simple (need explanation) [final-grtown]: The running aliens move their arms and legs and they run along a cubic path.
[x] articulated figure (need explanation) [final-grtown]: The running aliens and scooter aliens have articulated necks and limbs.
[x] advanced thing 1: has a challenge type (need the name and number from the list) [final-grtown]: (5) Animated shader effect.
[x] advanced thing 1: works properly, can be identified in the town (need explanation) [final-grtown]: The beam that appears underneath the flying saucer has an animated shader.
[x] advanced thing 1: points above and beyond (need explanation) [final-grtown]: The flying saucer's beam grows and shrinks over time, with different v values of vertices having different rates of change. There's also a ripple effect across the beam. Displacement is calculated with this code: (-4.*time*time+4.*time-.7) + (1.-uv.y)*(1.-uv.y)*(1.-time) + .1*sin((1.-uv.y)*(1.-uv.y)*100.)*(sin(uv.x*20.)) The fragment shader changes the beam's opacity over time, and also creates ripples in its color and opacity based on uv. 
[x] advanced thing 2: has a challenge type (need the name and number from the list) [final-grtown]: (4) Particle system
[x] advanced thing 2: works properly, can be identified in the town (need explanation) [final-grtown]: The swarms of fireflies are made using Sprites. They "blink" slowly and float around within an area.
[x] advanced thing 2: points above and beyond (need explanation) [final-grtown]: I just think they look very pretty. I made the texture myself (all textures attributed in attribution.txt) in Firealpaca. There are 6 different sprite textures in the scene (two for each swarm) so that each texture's opacity can change independently of the others and the scene still runs fast.
[x] advanced thing 3: has a challenge type (need the name and number from the list) [final-grtown]: (11) and (12) together. Procedurally generated geometry and noise
[x] advanced thing 3: works properly, can be identified in the town (need explanation) [final-grtown]: The wheat fields are planes that are algorithmically deformed using noise and then procedurally deformed to make geometric shapes (this is not done with a shader because I wanted to keep the MeshStandardMaterial lighting).
[x] advanced thing 3: points above and beyond (need explanation) [final-grtown]:  Each vertex is bumped upwards by a random amount to create a noisy, lumpy look, and vertices that happen to be bumped beyond a certain threshold are "stretched" to form tall wheat stalks. There's a check that discourages wheat stalks from forming on adjacent vertices, so that the stalks remain pointy and narrow. Then, depending on a parameter in the constructor, 1 of 3 designs is used: No crop circle, small crop circle, and large crop circle. Each of these designs are found in the scene. Wheat stalks are "cut" to form the designs using a method similar to the procedurally generated textures in WB10. I also painted textures for each of the designs that match the procedurally generated geometries (check attribution.txt).
